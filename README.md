Our project is called Streetsmart.

The goal of Streetsmart is to offer intelligent recommendations for users regarding travel routes.
The suggestions are based on area analysis, particularly with a focus on high traffic crime and 
dangerous places in general. The intention is to have users of the application feel safe when
they are out on the streets, and be able to take the route that prioritizes their safety. Our exigence
for creating this project is that we discussed the dangers of walking back home at night, around unfamiliar
areas and unprecedented routes, and emphasized the value in making something that could help ameliorate
those situations so that our community can be more protected as a whole.
